<h2 class="font_2"><span>Caught in the Crossfire</span></h2>
<p><em>Click. </em>The sound of death. Of lost limbs, broken hearts, and severed dreams.</p>
<p>Had it been imagined? Surely there would be no land mines here, in this cursed jungle, miles from the heart of the battles. But that definitive click, like the crashing of a gavel, still rung heavy in his hears. The verdant leaves shooting from the twisting branches around him remained still, the day devoid of even a faint breeze, unwilling to concede just one sweet moment of relief. The colorful birds chirped playfully, adding their voices to the cacophony of the Vietnam wildlife. As if nothing had happened.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s your own damn fault. </em>The thought lingered in his mind like the residue of a bad dream. It had been there since the damning click had sounded, maybe even earlier. But it began to devolve into something uglier, a caustic wave of guilt, of self-understanding. After all, it was he, who, in a frantic wave of panic, abandoned his comrades. Crawling on all fours for hours, like a dog, through the thick, uncooperative brush of the Vietnam jungle, the wet heat suffocating, time losing all meaning, clinging to the only idea that still mattered. Escape.</p>
<p>Billy had set him off. Only hours before the battle, Billy had shown him a faded snapshot of his newlywed wife. &ldquo;Just told me we&rsquo;re having a little boy,&rdquo; he had said, his voice dripping with pride. That was the first time he had seen that side of Billy. Before he had been the dedicated soldier. Finishing first in most drills, never questioning. But now the image of Billy that clung to his mind was a gurgling mess of a man, unable to understand the card he had been dealt.</p>
<p><em>Deserter</em>. The word reverberated in his brain. Accusing. Unforgiving. And doesn&rsquo;t the Bible say an eye for an eye? He had never given much attention to prayer when his parents had forced him to accompany them to church on Sundays. He would have done anything to avoid those outings. &nbsp;But now, facing the vacuous void of the unknown, God punctured his thoughts.</p>
<p>An unexpected wetness on his leg disrupted the whirlwind of his thoughts. For a second he thought he pissed himself, a fitting end, but then the culprit came into full view.</p>
<p>It was a little runt of a dog. Dirty, black matted fur did its best to hide the jagged scars and pale, emaciated flesh underneath. One of its legs had been cut short leaving a useless stub dangling in its place. It held the air of a mangled warrior emerging victorious from battle. A literal underdog. By no stretch of the imagination would it be considered cute, still, in a situation like this, any company was welcome.</p>
<p>The hound was flapping its tail back and forth as if expecting a treat and looking him hard in the eyes, begging for a playmate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I can&rsquo;t play with you. I&rsquo;m kinda stuck here,&rdquo; he said, trying to come off as reasonable. &nbsp;And he started laughing. A ferocious guffaw at the absurdity of the situation. Soon enough though, the laugh began to transform. Deep gasps turned to short, stunted breaths, in quick succession, like a rapid heartbeat, disrupted only by heavy, gut wrenching sobs. The dog watched curiously, head tilted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He went on like this for what seemed like hours, the vampire sun beating down mercilessly, before he felt the heavy weight pushing at his legs.</p>
<p>Panic gripped his body, stronger even than when he was on the battlefield. Death was imminent. A change in pressure and the mine could explode, dismembering his body, carpeting the dirt with his guts. He looked down and there he was- that runt- pushing violently at his leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stupid dog! You ugly runt! Are you trying to get us both killed!&rdquo; he cried. The dog pulled back with a start. He whimpered, his eyes big and puffy.</p>
<p>That look, it reminded him of his brother&rsquo;s dog when he was denied a treat. His brother. His brother! That&rsquo;s whose fault this all was! His brother was the root of all of his problems. &nbsp;Always separate, favored, elite. And he, the prodigal son, was forever shrouded in his shadow. His brother had had his own dog! What kind of family didn&rsquo;t share a dog, let each child love and care for it?</p>
<p>His brother had received the dog as a gift from their parents. The two had always pestered their parents about getting one, so naturally, when his brother hit the game winning home run for their little league team, a puppy yellow lab greeted them at home. Babe, he was called, after the Yankee great. And his brother loved that dog! He walked it every morning, taught it tricks, threw Frisbees for it to fetch. He spent hours and hours alone with Babe. Unfortunately, his brother wasn&rsquo;t capable of mustering up that same love for him. &nbsp;When he tried to pet Babe, his brother yelled at him. &ldquo;Get your own pet!&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t swing a bat like a girl, you&rsquo;d already have one.&rdquo; He was very possessive of that stupid dog.</p>
<p>At first, out of a bizarre form of jealousy, he had hated Babe, as if the dog was personally responsible for diverting all of his brother&rsquo;s affections. But then, as his brother got older and grew tired of walking Babe every morning, becoming more interested in chasing after girls, he was finally given a chance to take early morning strolls with the dog, collecting its feces. And he grew to love the dog like a brother. He felt they had a special bond. The bond of the forgotten. Of the alone. The overlooked.</p>
<p>Years later, his brother graduated college and headed off straight to the army, to follow in their father&rsquo;s footsteps: the courageous defenders of the country. Eclipsed by his brother all his life, he knew what he had to do to prove himself worthy of his parent&rsquo;s attention. So, he joined the army fresh out of college as well. Okay, his brother may have graduated from an Ivy League, but surely this would mean something! Unfortunately his parents didn&rsquo;t take so well to the idea. &ldquo;Why are you doing this?&rdquo; his father had asked. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t you. You&rsquo;re not a fighter. You don&rsquo;t have to prove anything to us.&rdquo; His mother echoed his father&rsquo;s concerns. What they didn&rsquo;t understand was that they were just egging him on. He <em>was</em> a fighter! And this was his chance to prove it.</p>
<p>If his brother hadn&rsquo;t joined the army. If he hadn&rsquo;t been so horrible to him. If he hadn&rsquo;t treated their relationship as a sibling rivalry in which he was always on top. Maybe, just maybe&hellip;</p>
<p>And then there was Monica. Pretty, perfect Monica. Always taunting him with her beauty, impossible to attain. Leading him on like an executioner to his gallows. Always flirting with the possibility of them together.</p>
<p>Had she though? Hadn&rsquo;t she rejected him on that sunny afternoon, when she was wearing that silky summer dress adorned with sky blue flowers? He had been working up the courage to ask her out for probably a year by then. All his friends had told him he had waited too long. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guys are too friendly now. It would just make things awkward,&rdquo; they had said. But something about the summer air, maybe it was the pollen or , made him dizzy with hopeless dreams.&nbsp; They group of them had gone down to the shore for a weekend. Spending the days soaking up the sun and the nights running along the boardwalk, wasting away all their quarters in the arcades. On their last day they ended up together going for ice cream while the rest of the crew was in the ocean. He had asked her then, ice cream in hand, walking back to the beach. A look had crossed her face when he said it, somewhere between embarrassment and pity. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re good as friends,&rdquo; she had said. She had tried to make small talk the rest of the way to break the painful silence. Talked about the weather and the rest of their summer plans. By the time they had reached the beach most of his ice cream had melted onto his hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But now when he thought of it, it didn&rsquo;t seem so certain after all. Maybe if he had been more insistent, if he had just found the right words to say&hellip;He had to show her that he was capable. What better way to do that then join the army. Fight for her. Protect her.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t she have just said yes! They could have been married, started a family. He wouldn&rsquo;t have joined the army then! He thought of them together after the war. His mind began to fade as he imagined her saying that she&rsquo;d changed her mind. Imagined the taste of her kiss, the touch of her hair-</p>
<p>A deep growl snapped him from his reverie. He opened his eyes with a start. Night was beginning to settle in. He could barely make out the sky through the dense branches overhead. A crowd of fat gray clouds had swept in like angry rioters, seeming to darken every passing moment. The wind began to pick up.</p>
<p>Wait a second. He realized that, lost in thought, he had been slowly fading into that welcoming fog of sleep. The dog! He couldn&rsquo;t believe it! He had been on the verge of falling asleep when the hound had emitted his angry growl. The dog had saved his life!</p>
<p>The dog was wagging its tail again, its tongue hanging from its mouth. Was it smiling? It looked happy, victorious even. He could have gotten down on his knees and given the dog a bear hug then. His savior. His guardian angel. But of course he wouldn&rsquo;t. It would surely set off the bomb. And that made him sadder than anything.</p>
<p>It was then that he felt the burning pangs of hunger. And even worse: the thirst. His mouth felt like sandpaper. His tongue a foreign object. His head felt light, a balloon. The wind, heavy with moisture, began to come in angry gusts, adding insult to injury. An incredible dizziness rushed over him. He was sure he would faint. The dog continued his raspy barking.</p>
<p>That wondrous, miraculous dog. Who stood by him when all hope was lost. Who risked its own life to keep him company, to warn him when he neared that nocturnal abyss, the one that would inevitably trigger the final plunge into darkness. He felt a flame ignite inside of him. A passion for this furry, scrawny creature. This faithful creature, who would never desert him.</p>
<p>And then, almost as quickly as it rose up, the flame was extinguished. Because he knew what he must do. Thick, wet drops began parading down mercilessly through the snarled branches above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away&rdquo; he said to the dog, trying his best to sound confident, commanding. His voice was a feeble thing, a faint whisper failing to escape his parched throat. The dog looked confused. It began to lick his leg again, although this time he couldn&rsquo;t distinguish the wet of its tongue from the wet of the rain. His uniform was drenched, his hair matted down around his eyes. Sopping wet socks and sneakers imprisoned his feet. Caked mud from his crawling escape earlier began to run down his shirt.</p>
<p>He swallowed a few times, attempting to accumulate at least a bit of moisture to line his throat. &ldquo;Go away&rdquo;, he tried. Again a whisper.</p>
<p>He began to sob. Quietly at first and then violently. The shivering induced by the rain only intensified the trembling of his famished and dehydrated body. &nbsp;What most concerned him was that he knew that it was probably around one-hundred degrees out. The rain should have been a welcome respite. So what was setting off this intense bout of shivering?</p>
<p>He gathered up the rest of his strength, his head dizzy, his body weak and tired. So tired. Oh how wonderful would if feel to sit down for just a few moments&hellip; And then he screamed. An ugly, guttural howl. More animalistic than human. His voice juddered and cracked, a hybrid of a cry and a command. But the word was clear: &ldquo;Goooooooo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog backpedaled a few steps, frightened. It didn&rsquo;t understand what was going on. After all, it only wanted to be his friend. To play with him&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goooo! Just gooooo! Get out of here! I&rsquo;m trying to save you, you stupid mutt!&rdquo; His voice was hoarse, his throat raw. But still he screamed and screamed, propelled only by the desire to save another. His voice was a wailing drone, repeating now: &ldquo;you poor mutt, you poor mutt&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, tail between its legs, the dog turned and began to scamper off. It dared look back only once, hoping that something would have changed, that it would be welcomed back, be played with, but the screaming continued on. Defeated, it turned back around and sadly hobbled away on its three good legs.</p>
<p>The rain began to slow. It was time. He had long ago accepted his fate but only now was he willing to embrace it. He sucked in deep breaths and began to count down from 10. Slowly. He could do this. <em>10, 9, 8</em>. He was revving himself up to die, but for the first time in his life he felt intoxicated with power. He was choosing his own fate.<em> 7, 6, 5</em>. &nbsp;He was in control, in the driver&rsquo;s seat. He was a <em>man</em>. Monica would have been proud. <em>4, 3. </em>Maybe his father would have changed his mind after all.<em> 2</em>. &ldquo;You <em>are</em> a fighter, son. And a damn good one at that.&rdquo; The words echoed in his ears and he willed them to be true, so they were.</p>
<p>And then he was at 1. He let go. Of everything. It was time.</p>
<p>He stepped off the mine. Eyes clenched shut, body braced.</p>
<p>And&hellip;nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing! Just the chirping of birds, the chirruping of crickets. He surveyed the jungle around him, wide eyed, only now allowing himself to take in its surreal splendor. The beautiful backdrop to so much pain and destruction. He was alive! Saved! God had spoken.</p>
<p>The sun was peeking between the clouds and he drank in a fresh gulp of air, delirious with joy. Oh beautiful air! It had never tasted so wonderful! Of life. Of possibility. He jumped up and down, adrenaline taking over, his arms raised. Victorious. He had come face to face with death and had made it out alive, the victor. He leapt to a nearby puddle and greedily cupped muddy water into his mouth. It tasted of freedom.</p>
<p>Once the excitement began to ebb, a thunderous roar emanated from his belly, an angry reminder of his hunger, his most constant companion. He cleaved to the idea that something, anything edible was nearby. Just around the corner. His legs began to carry him in the opposite direction of the battlefield that he had run from.</p>
<p>He glanced back once more at that god forsaken place from where he came. In the distance, past the tangled branches, he swore he could see the thinning shape of a dog, could hear a desperate whimper carried like pollen in the breeze. He could almost smell the sour stench of death threaded in the southerly winds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;He knew he could find his way back to the base if he tried. The battle had certainly ended by now. He could tell them he got lost and they would take him back with open arms, after all he had been AWOL for less than a day. He could fight hand in hand with his fellow soldiers again, make up for his mistakes. Return home a hero. But his decision had already been made. <em>Those poor souls, </em>he thought as he turned his back on the death behind him and walked towards life. <em>Those poor souls.</em></p>
<p>Only miles away, in a ravaged field with scarlet stained dirt, a lonely, three-legged dog lay still, encased in its own blood. Caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years later, he would try to pinpoint the happiest moment in his life. He knew it was a long time back. Before he finally returned home to hear that Monica had found a husband and moved away to some suburban town. Before his brother died a hero in battle, spawning a shame ridden funeral. Before he was convicted for desertion and sentenced to three years in prison followed by a dishonorable discharge. Even before he stepped off that mine, blessed with a second chance at life. The more he turned it over in his mind, the clearer it became: his greatest moment was when he prepared himself to step off that mine. When, fueled by his selfless act of mercy for that tattered hound, he had taken control of his own fate.</p>
<p>Sometimes he would close his eyes for a while and imagine that the mine had gone off, ending his life in that damned jungle. It had been years now since his parents had passed, and both of them had gone thinking of him as a failure, a shadow of his brother. But when he indulged in this fantasy, he would see his parents mourn for him, there brave, brave son. When he was eulogized, he would be talked about with respect and admiration. People would gather by his casket and speak of him in hushed voices. A hero.</p>
<p>These days he spent most of his time staring out the bedroom window of his assisted care living home. He wasn&rsquo;t looking for anything in particular, just watching the people go along their daily routines. Their fledgling lives were fresh with possibilities. They still had infinitely many choices to make, people to meet, jobs to fill. It made him think of the string of choices that made up his life, each one a fallen domino leading to this god forsaken place.&nbsp; A place of waiting. For his next meal. For sleep. For death to take his hand.</p>
<p>A sort of comfort warmed him when he saw these people, their future still a blank slate. He imagined himself in their shoes, no war in the way, strolling home to a family, a future. &nbsp;Hobbling beside him was a scrawny black mutt and he carefully maintained a slow pace so that it could keep up on its three good legs. He never let it go past there though, the knot tightening in the back of his throat. Instead, they would turn the corner, nothing remaining but a fabricated memory and a dusty window. &nbsp;</p>

<div class = "The Ball">
<h2 class="font_2"><span>The Ball</span></h2>
<p>Tommy sat behind Katy in their 6<sup>th</sup> Grade Math class for 118 days before the epiphany of how he would approach her finally hit him square in the face. He had spent countless hours in class playing over different scenarios in his head, how he would start the conversation and how she would respond, in the hallway after class or the cafeteria at lunch, but it always seemed stupid, inauthentic.&nbsp; Of course they were just fantasies, he didn&rsquo;t have the guts to actually approach her, and what would they talk about anyway? He knew that Buddy, one of the bigger kids who could have easily passed as a high schooler and would often talk about girls like they were a game he was exceptional at, would talk to her without a problem. Probably flirt with her even, a concept so foreign to Tommy that it may as well have been a different language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, while Miss. Madison was squeaking some equations onto the board with a broken piece of chalk, Tommy was daydreaming about the Guinness Book of World Records that he had read cover to cover multiple times at home. He was sure he was destined to break one of them, so he spent the class figuring out which one he would try his hand at. No matter which other record he began thinking about (even the gross ones like longest fingernails) his mind kept returning to the world&rsquo;s largest rubber band ball. He didn&rsquo;t know why. Maybe it was because he had heard that Katy was on the tennis team, and, while it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a tennis ball, it was the only way he could think of connecting with her. Or was it something simpler, something clawing just beneath the surface. A drive to build, to create, to be something, someone. Whatever the reason, his mind was set. He would make the world&rsquo;s largest rubber band ball and he would give it to Katy as a gift. When he gave it over, he wouldn&rsquo;t mention that he was famous because of the ball, his picture on one of the crisp front pages of the new 2008 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records. The only important thing was that she know he had made it for her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After school, the bus dropped him off on the corner of his street. He walked by his house and continued down the block to the local Dollar Tree. Fall was settling in comfortably and a brisk bite was sneaking into the air. Browning leaves, glittered by the dappled sun, littered the sidewalks, nobody willing to spend the time raking them up. Sparrows made a ruckus overhead as they dove from tree to tree and squirrels continued their frenzied dash through the yellowing grass to collect acorns before the winter season came in full. Tommy barely noticed any of it. He broke into his 8 dollars and 50 cents of allowance money and bought a bag of 150 multicolored rubber bands. When his mom asked him what he had in the shopping bag, he said a Reece&rsquo;s. She told him not to spoil his appetite before dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner was an exercise in patience. The ball looked like nothing more than a few rubber bands unsuccessfully squished together when Tommy was called down. If it was his Mom&rsquo;s voice, he could have kept at it for a few more minutes, but he knew not to keep his Dad waiting. That could result in a bout of severe screaming and a tight knot in the back of Tommy&rsquo;s throat. Tommy never knew when his dad would go off after a long day at work. Better to avoid that. So he parted ways with his sad excuse for a ball and plodded downstairs. At this rate it would take him years to reach the record! The familiar stench of vegetables trying to double as meat filled Tommy&rsquo;s head as he made his way down the stairs.</p>
<p><em>ESPN</em> was streaming from the small TV on the counter across from the table when Tommy stepped into the kitchen. His dad and sister were already seated and his mom was filling the plates. Green beans and vegan meatballs. Ugh. Tommy took a seat in silence, trying not to let his disgust show. &ldquo;This looks amazing mom!&rdquo; his sister, Julia, said. Tommy swallowed. Any response would be an insult to his mom&rsquo;s cooking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Tommy studied his plate and his appetite dissipated. The meatballs were smothered in a blanket of sugarless sauce, as if that made what was hiding underneath any more appealing. The scratch of silverware against plates filled the room, everyone&rsquo;s eyes glued to the TV, even though the only one who really cared what the sportscasters had to say was Tommy&rsquo;s father. Tommy fiddled with the green beans on his plate, trying to craft a smiley face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how was school today Tommy?&rdquo; his mom asked in a raised tone, trying to compete with the voices from the TV. Tommy continued to work assiduously on his smiley face, using the meatballs for eyes. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, not bothering to look up. One of the sports commentators was going off on an angry rant about the Yankee&rsquo;s coaching.</p>
<p>His mother sighed in frustration. &ldquo;Henry can you turn that damn thing off! I&rsquo;m trying to have a conversation with my son!&rdquo; An annoyed grunt ensued as his father clicked the TV off and returned to his plate. When his mom wasn&rsquo;t looking, Tommy&rsquo;s father shot him a quick wink. Tommy smiled. He didn&rsquo;t think his father was all that happy with the lack of meat either.</p>
<p>Julia started up. &ldquo;Well <em>I</em> had a great day! Me and Kevin finally started talking again. Katherine told me that I should just go up to him and, like, tell him how I feel&hellip;&rdquo; Tommy zoned the rest out. He was thinking instead of Katy, and how she would flip her hair sometimes in the seat in front of him and it would almost brush against his face. How she would never raise her hand, but would always know the answer when called on, like she didn&rsquo;t want to show off unless she had to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Julia cut into his reverie. &ldquo;Tommy, why are you wasting good food? You know how many children in Africa would kill for that?&rdquo; She was poking the bear, trying to provoke a reaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tommy finally looked up from his plate. &ldquo;I think a child in Africa would fall over and die before touching this with a ten foot pole.&rdquo; He regretted the words almost as he was saying them, but they were already out, the soundwaves traveling through the air unimpeded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>His sister had cast the bait and he had bit. Now she began to reel him in. &ldquo;How could you be so shallow Tommy! It&rsquo;s one thing to not care about animals but you don&rsquo;t care about people either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone settle down,&rdquo; his father interjected. &ldquo;Tommy was clearly joking.&rdquo; He was trying to lighten the atmosphere but it was still taught with broiling tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son just criticized my cooking and that&rsquo;s all you have to say, Tim!&rdquo; His mother was fuming.</p>
<p>His dad looked like he was searching for a way out of a trap he had stumbled into. &ldquo;Well this isn&rsquo;t really <em>your </em>cooking is it? This whole &lsquo;no meat thing&rsquo; is Julia&rsquo;s idea. If Tommy criticized your hamburgers it would be a different story.&rdquo; He snickered hoping it would relieve the thickening tension. Tommy couldn&rsquo;t resist the smile forming on his face. His mother&rsquo;s eyes caught his. She wasn&rsquo;t smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think this is funny Tommy,&rdquo; his mother said. She paused, contemplating her next move. &ldquo;Go to your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t send me to my room Mom. I&rsquo;m 12 years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you act like you&rsquo;re five,&rdquo; his sister chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia, stop criticizing your brother. All guys enjoy watching ESPN. It doesn&rsquo;t make him immature.&rdquo; He winked at Tommy again. Tommy&rsquo;s smile faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; Tommy said, his voice brimming with bottled-up frustration. &ldquo;I <em>will </em>go to my room. I&rsquo;m done with this bullshit.&rdquo; He stormed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy you get back here right now and apologize! Don&rsquo;t talk to your parents with that language!&rdquo; His mother&rsquo;s calls trailed him as he thundered his way upstairs, deliberately slamming his feet down on each step.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was full of trial and error. Who knew starting a rubber band ball would be so hard? Tommy&rsquo;s anger slowly faded as he channeled his pent up frustration into the task at hand. The painstaking process bathed him in a cool calm, and regret for his behavior at dinner began to flood in. An hour or so later, his mother knocked on the door, asking if she could come in with a soft voice. He frantically hid the ball and supplies under his bed and opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Tommy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know you didn&rsquo;t mean what you said. Your sister is always provoking you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay mom. I&rsquo;m sorry too,&rdquo; Tommy found himself saying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft kiss was planted on his forehead. His mom seemed surprised by the drastic swing in his mood, but didn&rsquo;t question it. &ldquo;Ok honey have a good night,&rdquo; she said and left him to his devices. By midnight, Tommy was tucked under his covers, reading the new Harry Potter book by the lamplight, the ball a little knot on the bedside table. He was on his way to the record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the rest of the rest of the month, Tommy worked furiously on that ball. If his hands weren&rsquo;t already preoccupied, they were twisting on rubber bands. At home, on the bus, in the cafeteria, even in class, although his teachers had threatened to confiscate it multiple times. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Every free moment was a blur of folded or stretched rubber bands being carefully added to the compact oval collection. A week in, whispers and funny glances began follow him through the hallways. At first they would mock him, the freak whose only friends were a bunch of rubber bands. But as time wore on and empty rubber band bags accumulated underneath Tommy&rsquo;s bed, the murmurs were infiltrated with a touch of respect, and Tommy seemed to be lit by the aura of a man on a mission. Tommy didn&rsquo;t notice the whispers or sideways glances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nights were the same. He would run up the stairs as soon as he got back from school, toss his backpack by his bed, and cloister himself in his room. When dinner arrived, he would shove the food in his mouth, barely allowing himself time to chew and swallow, mumble a few good&rsquo;s and yes&rsquo;s to his mother&rsquo;s barrage of questions, and head back upstairs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rush?&rdquo; His dad would ask. &ldquo;You got a girl waiting for you up there?&rdquo; Tommy would laugh and hope the red on his face didn&rsquo;t linger. His mother was ecstatic that he was taking so well to their new diet. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you be more like your son, honey?&rdquo; she would ask his father &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really coming around. You really shouldn&rsquo;t take your wife&rsquo;s cooking for granted.&rdquo; Tommy no longer received any surreptitious winks from his father.</p>
<p>A month in, Tommy&rsquo;s allowance savings ran dry and suddenly every drawer he passed was practically glowing with promise, a gold mine waiting to be dug up. When his parents were preoccupied on the couch downstairs with an episode of Law &amp; Order, Tommy rummaged furiously through their cabinets and drawers. He was rewarded with a few scraggly rubber bands that had been hiding deep in one of the drawers, hardened and dusty with age. At school the next day, he waited till after class or during recess, and felt through the desk drawers in a nervous frenzy, hoping no one would walk in on him. &nbsp;All he found were a few long neglected rubber bands, so old that that cracks formed in them like his grandmother&rsquo;s wrinkles when he bent them.</p>
<p>Late that night, when the house was still as a tomb and blacker than the night outside, Tommy creaked down the stairs on his tiptoes and felt his way to the kitchen. He carefully pulled the drawer open and felt for the plastic bag that his family kept for loose change. The last time he had seen the bag was the day before, amidst his search for more rubber bands. It had mostly contained quarters but a few dollar bills had made their way into it over time as well. At that time the thought hadn&rsquo;t crossed his mind of taking the money. There was an unspoken rule in the house that he and his sister could take only a few quarters when they needed if they asked permission. His fingers closed in on the familiar shapes of the coins and he slipped the entire bag into his pocket. &nbsp;Relieved, he turned to head back up to the safety of his room. The light clicked on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, is that you?&rdquo; His father stood by the entrance, puzzled. The bright lights stung Tommy&rsquo;s eyes, his head still reeling from shock. He felt as if a policeman had caught him breaking into a shop at night, the cop&rsquo;s flashlight burning Tommy&rsquo;s eyes as he was interrogated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing up this late?&rdquo; his father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip;I was just getting a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh ok then. You better get back to sleep or you won&rsquo;t be able to stay awake at school tomorrow.&rdquo; Tommy&rsquo;s father no longer seemed so intimidating. Heavy bags drooped under his eyes and he was squinting from the light as well. Tommy couldn&rsquo;t help the strong wave of guilt that rushed from his heart when his father matted Tommy&rsquo;s hair with his palm as Tommy passed by him. But when he bought the new bag of rubber bands the next day, his guilt was buried under a far more pleasant, giddy feeling. Lightheaded and focused, he continued his work on the ball. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime the next month, he realized that the rubber bands no longer fit his ball. On the bus ride over that morning, he had attempted to stretch one of the yellow rubber bands around the ball and it had split right in half. He had tried a red one then. Same result. He was stumped. Luckily he had the rest of the ride to brainstorm for a solution. By the time he was walking up the steps of school, he&rsquo;d figured it out.</p>
<p>The answer was simple: He would attach two rubber bands together to make one jumbo rubber band. He had given the idea a few test runs towards the end of the ride and it had worked seamlessly. So he plowed on through the classes, sitting in the back, splitting the rubber bands in half and then tying them together at each end. This new technique required more finesse and patience than before, especially when tying the tiny knots, but it was all worth it when he got to manipulate the band onto the ball at the end.</p>
<p>It was back in math class, Miss Madison going over the previous night&rsquo;s homework, when he picked out the stubborn rubber band from the bag. One of the blue ones, which happened to be his favorite color. He gave it a strong tug from each side in opposite directions, just like he had the others. It didn&rsquo;t give. &nbsp;He tried again, same result. Growing impatient, he wrapped the fingers of each hand around a separate side, held it out in front of him, and yanked in opposite directions with all his strength. The result seemed to unfold in slow motion. Rather than split in half, the rubber band expanded to maximum length then slipped off his fingertips. The momentum of Tommy&rsquo;s forceful pulls propelled it forward at high speed. It hung in the air for what seemed like an eternity, panic rising in Tommy&rsquo;s chest, then connected with the back of Katy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>She cried &ldquo;Ow&rdquo; and her hand reflexively shot to the spot where she had been hit. She turned in her chair and shot him a furious glare. He wanted to say he was sorry, to explain himself, but he couldn&rsquo;t find his voice. He looked down, red-faced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy!&rdquo; Miss Madison shouted. &ldquo;Did you just shoot Katy with a rubber band?&rdquo; Her thin, pointy face was starting to boil over.</p>
<p>A few kids snickered. They sometimes called her Miss &ldquo;Mad&rdquo; and loved it when she lived up to the nickname. Tommy didn&rsquo;t know what to say. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t&hellip;I mean it wasn&rsquo;t...&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;ve had it up to here with you and that stupid ball!&rdquo; She stomped over to Tommy and grabbed the ball from his desk. Everyone&rsquo;s eyes were on him, even Katy&rsquo;s. His face felt hot. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have this back when you mature a bit.&rdquo; She strolled back to her desk and dropped the ball into one of its drawers. The class returned its gaze to the front of the room. The show was over.</p>
<p>A lump began to form in Tommy&rsquo;s throat. His mind was a flurry of angry thoughts. His fury at Miss Madison was easier to face than the mounting resignation underneath, the spot in his heart that harbored hopes of winning over Katy dimming. As the class droned on though, he began to settle down and the seeds of a plan began to sprout. His dreams seemed to be within arm&rsquo;s length once again. When Miss Madison was turned around, he quietly ripped a paper from his notebook and folded it into his pocket. A few minutes before class ended, he left to the bathroom. He waited in a stall for the bell to ring and unfolded the paper from his pocket. He began to write, using his lap to rest the paper on as he sat on the toilet seat. It wasn&rsquo;t the most comfortable, but he wanted to be alone when he wrote it. Five minutes later, he headed straight back to the classroom.</p>
<p>As he had hoped, the room was vacant, the lights shut off. Slowly, he made his way to Miss. Madison&rsquo;s desk and pulled at the top drawer. To his surprise, the drawer opened easily, with only a slight squeak of rusty hinges, and there lay his ball by a sprinkling of paperclips, a stapler, and some other dusty office supplies. Something in the corner of his eye made him jump. A sigh of relief calmed his jangled nerves when he realized it was only his shadow. He looked at the door once more to make sure no one was about to enter, grabbed the ball, and shoved it into his pocket. Quickly, he retrieved his backpack from the back row and made his way back to the front of the room. After checking the hallway through the door&rsquo;s window to make sure the coast was clear, he walked out with a spring in his step and hands in his pockets to cover the bulge by his thigh.</p>
<p>On the way to his next class he stopped off by Katy&rsquo;s locker. Opening it felt like looking through her personal diary. Pictures of her and friends at different ages and juvenile drawings of hers littered the inside of the door. Her books were stacked neatly inside, a well-constructed tower. He thought of how his locker looked like a dump in comparison, notebooks and textbooks thrown in haphazardly. He considered dropping the ball in the locker, but the thought was met with a gnawing resistance in his gut- the way he felt when he saw pictures of people with missing limbs and tried to imagine himself in their shoes. Instead, he placed his note atop her tower of books, careful not to tip it over, and shut the door.</p>
<p>The next day, Tommy was buzzing with that tingle that arrived when hard work was on the verge of completion and a final product was ready to emerge. His creation was about the size of a volleyball now. If he bounced it just right he could even dribble it, otherwise it would bounce awkwardly to the side. Maybe it didn&rsquo;t quite make the record but after the note that he had slipped into Katy&rsquo;s locker yesterday, he knew it was time to give over the ball. Of course, with that rush of excitement came a crippling wave of fear because it meant Tommy would have to approach Katy once and for all. It hit him that he had no clue how he would give her the ball, what he would say. Another feeling crept into his gut, one of imminent loss, but he couldn&rsquo;t understand its presence so he pushed it back down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the months of amassing, Tommy had almost forgotten that his school was filled with other people. He had felt like he and the ball were alone, in a sort of dream state, and all that mattered was the world record and Katy. Unfortunately some of his class mates hadn&rsquo;t forgotten about him and didn&rsquo;t share the newfound respect of their classmates. Some still thought of him as a loser with no friends, and detested the attention he was receiving in their classmate&rsquo;s conversations, the almost mythical status he had achieved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey Tommy, Can I see your new ball?&rdquo; Buddy asked as they stepped off the bus that morning. The question may have seemed innocent enough but Buddy&rsquo;s tone coupled with his defiant smirk screamed trouble. They were at the corner of the street by an open manhole flanked by two cones. Workers had been laboring down there all week, something wrong with the water pipes. The rest of the kids had emptied from the bus and were already on their way up the stairs and through the front doors of school. &nbsp;Tommy imagined Buddy taking a wrong step and falling in the manhole, but a harsh breeze snapped him into reality. Throughout the bus ride, Tommy had clutched the ball firm in his fists like a talisman, trying to conjure up a plan for approaching Katy. Buddy must have noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Uh&hellip;It&rsquo;s not really done yet&hellip;&rdquo; Tommy replied, not meeting Buddy&rsquo;s mocking gaze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Tommy even looked up, Buddy was on him, his hands wrestling for the ball. A few seconds later, it was secured in Buddy&rsquo;s grip. What could Tommy do? Buddy was bigger and stronger. A brusque breeze cut through Tommy&rsquo;s sweatshirt and jeans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gosh, I just wanted to see it moron. Don&rsquo;t know why you have to make such a big deal,&rdquo; Buddy said, catching his breath.&nbsp; They were still in the spot where the bus had dropped them off, the double doors to school just up the steps. Tommy looked around nervously, hoping to see a teacher. No one was paying them any attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you use it like a hackey sack?&rdquo; Buddy wondered aloud. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t wait for a reply before he began his clumsy attempt at juggling the ball with his feet. It was far too large and heavy too be kicked around. Growing angry with the ball for not complying with his wishes, Buddy kicked it. It rolled cockeyed, crunching over some dead leaves, the uneven rubber bands stunting its smooth route. By the time Tommy realized that it was headed straight for the manhole, it was already too late. &nbsp;His breath caught in his gut as the ball reached its destination and fell silently over the edge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oops. Guess you&rsquo;ll have to make a new one,&rdquo; Buddy said unsympathetically. And he walked off. Tears welled up in Tommy&rsquo;s eyes. He crouched by the black hole and looked down. There was no trace of his ball. Like it never existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tommy stood up slowly. He began to step onto the curb towards school and then froze. There, at the top of the stairs, was Katy. She was looking down at him from above, her head tilted ever so slightly, a cardigan wrapped around her slim frame to cut away at the cool breeze. Her eyes were heavy. Her hair shivered softly against her cheeks, which were rosy from the morning chill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in the distance a bell rang, lockers clattered, and footsteps fluttered. But there, at the bottom of the looming stairwell, Tommy&rsquo;s stood still as a statue, his gaze lingering. He resisted the urge to look away. Something stirred in his chest. And then, in a flash, she turned and walked through the double doors, leaving him alone at the bottom of the stairs, his hands curled in balls, gripping something that used to be there but was now gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the day tortured Tommy. He moved from class to class like a zombie, with no word from Katy and no rubber band ball to pass the time. He had hoped she would have at least confronted him about the note. Things began to seem even bleaker when Math class rolled around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Miss Madison told them she had an announcement to make at the start of class. She cleared her throat. &ldquo;As you all know, I confiscated a ball from our neighborhood rubber band aficionado yesterday. But when I checked my desk this morning, the drawer was empty. Now, I&rsquo;m gonna assume that the ball didn&rsquo;t push its way out and roll away on its own, so I would like it if the culprit could make him or herself known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence. Everybody was looking around the room, trying to identify the guilty party, searching for a glimmer of fear in one of their classmate&rsquo;s eyes. Tommy felt his armpits go wet. Miss Madison was staring at him. He swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you tell me now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll only get a detention.&rdquo; As if that was the dream! She gave the room another look around. &ldquo;But if I find out later, the consequences will be much more severe.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tommy waited a few more seconds, hoping for some sort of distraction. None came. Slowly, he began to lift his hand. But before Miss Madison could make out his gesture, Katy&rsquo;s hand shot up in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes Katy?&rdquo; Miss Madison wore a mask of confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to snitch on a classmate, but I saw Buddy steal it from your drawer after class yesterday.&rdquo; She sounded confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lying!&rdquo; Buddy cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t touch that stupid ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Katy challenged. &ldquo;So I didn&rsquo;t see you trying to play hackeysack with it this morning? I could have sworn you were too uncoordinated to keep it up in the air and ended up losing it in the manhole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few kids snickered. Buddy was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, Ok that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Miss Madison. &ldquo;Buddy, you have detention tonight. I hope you brought a good book with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, Tommy fell asleep to the memory of Buddy&rsquo;s face when he registered those words. Sheer disbelief. Tommy fell asleep with a fading smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in the next few years, a hurricane hit hard. Katrina was it? No that came much later. Whatever its name, it was marked by heavy winds and torrential downpours through the east coast. Tommy and his sister had stripped down to their bathing suits and jumped and danced in the whipping rain, letting the gusts carry them, their bodies weightless as the fall leaves. The next day, Tommy had heard stories of young kids who were playing outside when the storm delivered its worst, being swept up like crumbs into the gutters by the flooding.</p>
<p>Late at night, at that young age when the world was still infused with its waning magical tint, Tommy would imagine those young boys and girls alive and happy. He would see them floating peacefully in the gutter water, tossing around his rubber band ball. Sometimes he thought, if he listened very closely when passing a gutter or manhole, he could hear the faint echo of their laughs, the distant clamor of kids in the playground. Later he would remember how he finally approached Katy at lunch and thanked her for lying about Buddy. How they had shared a good laugh when she told him that everyone in the class had taken to referring to him as &ldquo;Rubber Band Boy.&rdquo; How they would sit across from each other in the cafeteria every day after that, talking about things that he couldn&rsquo;t remember anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, all things pass, and Katy was only his first girlfriend. They had a good run, but broke up a few years later in high school, their separate lives taking shape with no space for the other. His life had taken many twists and turns since then, but it all led to a familiar place. A job, a marriage, kids, the usual story. But now and again he would think of that note he had written her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about shooting you,&rdquo; it had read in a messy scrawl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really the way I wanted to get you to notice me. I&rsquo;ll try to make it up to you soon.&rdquo; Even now he could still see her standing atop that stairwell as clear as day, her eyes deep and moist. And he would wonder how he could feel so full and so empty at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div id="WRchTxt3" class="s12" data-reactid=".0.$SITE_ROOT.$desktop_siteRoot.$PAGES_CONTAINER.1.1.$SITE_PAGES.$csgz.1.$WRchTxt3">
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gershon opened his eyes. To say he awoke would be false because he had not been sleeping, he&rsquo;d been waiting.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked over at his wife Anne, at that once beautiful, almost perfect face that had wrinkled over time. She was 70 years old now but still looked beautiful to him. He remembered that once stunning face that hid underneath that mask of wrinkles, her ocean blue eyes and golden blonde hair. Still, time had been much kinder to her than it had to him.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he pushed himself silently out of bed, ignoring the scream of his aching bones, he recalled the doctor&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;<span>It&rsquo;s time for you to take that vacation you&rsquo;ve always dreamed of</span>. He remembered wanting to scream back, I survived the holocaust damnit! You think a tumor can take me down. Those words though, spoken to him a year ago, reminded him of the task he needed to complete before death took him away as it had every last one of his relatives. About the Nazi officer and the gun.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took a while for Gershon to roll out of bed due to his trembling bones. The side effects of that damn medicine. He didn&rsquo;t want to take it, thought it did more harm than good, but whenever he expressed his sentiments to Anne, she replied, "Would you rather be alive and shaking or still and dead?" When it was put that way it didn&rsquo;t seem like he had much of a choice.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Gershon finally made it out of bed, his eyes focused on the digital clock which provided a dim light in the otherwise completely dark room.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two in the morning. It was time.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He crouched down, a gesture which took much more effort than it should have, and groped underneath the bed. For a second he thought it was not there. Had Anne found it? Dozens of possibilities rushed through his head. But his fear was soon quelled when he felt the familiar cool touch of metal. He pulled it in and studied it in the faint light emitted by the clock.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gun was dusty and worn out by time but it still had the same feel. The same weight- neither heavy nor light.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He felt the memory approaching like a headache that had not yet formed but was readying itself to rip through your forehead with no mercy. The type he&rsquo;d been having too many of lately. He pushed the memory off. There was no time to waste. He had to get going.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he walked toward the door his eyes rested on Anne once more. First, he thought about when they first met. How they were so similar. Both their parents died when they were young, both escaped the ruthless Nazis. Then, he thought about the other nights. When she would get up at three in the morning and leave, only to come back an hour later. She did this almost every night thinking he was asleep. She did not know that he never slept deeply. Not since he was a boy in Nazi Germany, hiding underneath the wooden floorboard. Waiting for the creak of the floor underneath a soldier&rsquo;s boot, for the soldier to tear through the floor and scream,&nbsp;<span>You think you can hide from us you dirty Jew</span>? with that evil grin on his face and then point the gun and shoot&hellip;</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gershon&rsquo;s grip tightened on the gun handle as he shook off the memory.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s my turn to take a walk tonight</span>,&nbsp;<span>Anne</span>, he thought as he walked through the door.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It felt cool for a summer night but he wasn't sure if he was just feeling the lasting effects of the memory of that cold winter night in Berlin.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The walk to the Nazi&rsquo;s house did not take long, although it felt like hours due to the pain in his legs and his growing anticipation and anxiety.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He did not enter the house when he arrived. Instead, he sat on the steps and mulled over what he would say-if he would say anything at all. He willed himself not to let his emotions take over. After a couple of minutes of fading in and out of a pool of memories he got up and twisted the door knob.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To Gershon&rsquo;s surprise the door was not locked. He had been almost sure he would have to pick the lock to get through. Only now did he realize that he didn't have the equipment or the skills to do so. If it had been locked, he would have not been able to get in. It was almost like the Nazi had been expecting a visitor.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This made Gershon think about fate and coincidences. Was it a coincidence that this man, whom Gershon thought he&rsquo;d never see again, lived only a few blocks from his house? Was it fate that after 60 years of not knowing where this man lived, Gershon found his address through a simple Google search. A page about how Lukas Muller was now part of a Jewish Community Organization, how he wanted to give back to a world in which he had lived for 95 years.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The interior of the house was the same as any other except for the pictures- or lack thereof. There was not a single picture on the white washed walls. Not one hint that Lukas had a past.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gershon found Lukas sleeping in the first room that he looked in. When Gershon came closer to inspect the old man, tears welled up in his eyes. It was the same man. The man he had seen all those years ago on that frozen night, donned in that horrible Nazi uniform. And then the memory came at full power, so vivid, as if he was reliving the moment.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was 1938. A cold winter night in Berlin.</em></span></span></h6>
<p class="font_8"><span><span class="color_20"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Gershon first heard the knock on the front door he thought,&nbsp;</em>pappa is home<em>! His mother had told him that his father had gone away for a couple of days to visit his relatives in Munich. Of course at the innocuous, gullible age of 12, he had believed her. Only afterwards did Gershon find out that the Nazis had taken his father and that he had met the same fate as Gershon&rsquo;s mother and so many others Gershon had known- the gas chambers. Almost immediately after the knock his mother came running into his room, his 6 year old sister scared in her arms.</em></span><em>​</em></span></p>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; she whispered. Then, &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo;</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking from head to toe out of a mixture of the cold and his pure, unadulterated terror, Gershon followed his mother down the stairs to the kitchen. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening? Where&rsquo;s pappa?&rdquo; he wanted to ask, but his voice stuck in his throat.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She quickly bent to the floor and swiftly, almost mechanically, as if she&rsquo;d practiced it many times, removed two wooden boards. She pushed Gershon and his sister into the small space underneath the floorboards and began to place the boards above the small bodies of her only two children.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she put the last floorboard in its place, Gershon asked &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming, Momma?&rdquo;</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All she responded was, &ldquo;I love you sweety, always remember that. I love you more than anything in the whole world.&rdquo; She looked away before her children could see the tears streaming down her pallid face. &ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; she said, and then placed the last tile in the kitchen floor and answered the door.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gershon heard his mother say, &ldquo;Hello officers, what can I do for you?&rdquo; from the small black hole underneath the floor.&nbsp; He heard an officer ask, &ldquo;Where is everyone else.&rdquo; No response came. Then he heard a hard slap and the same officer say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the bitch. Lukas go check the rest of the house. If you find one of those Jewish pigs shoot them in the face.&rdquo;</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; came the response.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long, agonizing minutes slowly crept by before Gershon heard the creek of the footsteps on the kitchen floor. His stomach knotted in apprehension. He tried to hold in his breath, but his lungs felt as if they would burst. Slowly, the dreaded sound moved toward him, as if the soldier was trying to to drag it out as long as possible, until the tile was lifting up and the officer&rsquo;s face and the black gun in his hand came into view.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gershon cringed and covered his sister, as if the Nazi wouldn&rsquo;t see her behind his small, fragile body.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; the voice said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&rdquo;</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The deep blue eyes that had seemed so cold and cruel only a moment ago were now filled with warmth and kindness. The Nazi crouched down and handed over his gun to Gershon, who, at first afraid to touch it, took it hesistanty in his feeble hands.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Protect yourself,&rdquo; were the Nazi&rsquo;s last words before he placed the floorboards back in their place and walked the other way.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Muller, Did you find any of those dirty bastards?&rdquo; Gershon heard the voice say.</em></span></span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The familiar voice of the Nazi officer who had just saved Gershon&rsquo;s life answered &ldquo;No, it was empty.&rdquo;</em></span></span></h6>
<p class="font_7">&nbsp;</p>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t have a choice. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;These were the words that cut through Gershon&rsquo;s memory and brought him back to the present. Lukas was jolting in his sleep, screaming desperate, frantic words. His wizened face was twisted in an amalgamation of regret, horror, and anguish.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gershon&rsquo;s first reaction was to step back. He felt like he was a boy again, cringing at the Nazi crouching over him. Then he stepped forward and shook the man&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the man&rsquo;s heavy eyelids lifted up, his eyes were clouded with confusion. After a few seconds of staring into Gershon&rsquo;s face, a flicker of recognition lit up in Lukas&rsquo;s eyes.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Am I dreaming?&rdquo; he croaked.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choking back his tears, Gershon answered &ldquo;No, I came to return something to you.&rdquo;</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>He lifted up the gun that had protected him is whole life, the same gun which he had killed two Nazi&rsquo;s with in his quivering hand, and placed it on Lukas&rsquo;s stomach.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment Lukas did nothing, just stared at Gershon. Then he curled his callused, gnarled&nbsp; hands around the gun, held it up, and began to sob heavy, guttural cries.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, Gershon heard a familiar voice say, &ldquo;Gershon?&rdquo; Gershon whipped around. Ice cold ran through his veins as their eyes met and they stared at each other in shock and confusion.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He managed to say, &ldquo;Anne, did you follow me?&rdquo; The answer was the last thing he expected yet somehow, deep inside he had known it all along.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I come here every night to comfort my father, he has post traumatic stress disorder,&rdquo; she said, her face knotted in confusion.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gershon heard these words but his brain refused to register them. Why was she talking about her father now? She had told him when they first met that her father died when she was young? Then, realization flooded in and it all clicked together, all of what he thought to be small coincidences now fit into one big picture.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not a coincidence that Lukas Muller lived only a few blocks from their house. He lived there so he would be close to Anne, his daughter, Gershon&rsquo;s wife. So she could comfort him when the demons from his past visited him in his sleep.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The front door had not been open because he had expected Gershon but because Anne came every night.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So many questions whirled through his head.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me your father was still alive?&rdquo;&nbsp; he asked.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I told him that I was converting to Judaism and marrying a Jew and he said that he would rather I pretend he was dead than tell a Jew that my father was a Nazi.&rdquo;</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gershon could not believe what he was hearing. The man that had saved his life was now his father in law. He&rsquo;d been so scared, so ashamed of his past, that he had pretended that he was dead.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gershon looked over at the 95 year old man and saw that the realization had just dawned on him as well. He realized that all those years ago, on that cold winter night, he had saved his daughter&rsquo;s husband. His singular act of kindness had brought joy and love to his daughter&rsquo;s life.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A cool placidness covered the old man&rsquo;s face.</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&ldquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I can finally rest in peace.&rdquo;</span></h6>
<h6 class="font_6"><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A warm smile spread across his face as he closed his eyes, brought the gun to his head, and pulled the trigger.</span></span></h6>
